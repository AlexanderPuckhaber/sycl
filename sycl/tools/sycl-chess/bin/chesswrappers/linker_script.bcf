// ME Tile has access to 128 KBs of memory (32 KiBs are its own), partitioned
// into 4 32 KiB blocks this can also be partitioned eveen further into 8 for
// even/odd banks of 16 KiB
//
// The max program size is 16 KiBs (so the AIE ELF binary cannot be larger)
//
// Addresses in Hex:
// 0x00020000 – 0x00027FFF = 32 KiBs of memory, South Memory
// 0x00028000 – 0x0002FFFF = 32 KiBs of memory, West Memory
// 0x00030000 – 0x00037FFF = 32 KiBs of memory, North Memory
// 0x00038000 – 0x0003FFFF = 32 KiBs of memory, East Memory
//
// Decimal Conversion:
// 131072 - 163839 = 32767 bytes of memory, South Memory
// 163840 – 196607 = 32767 bytes of memory, West Memory
// 196608 – 229375 = 32767 bytes of memory, North Memory
// 229376 – 262143 = 32767 bytes of memory, East Memory
//
// Linker Script Gen:
// 1) This current .bcf linker script only uses north memory
// 2) 0x400 is for the stack and it's in the north memory
// 3) Another 0x400 is for the arguments inside of main that are used to copy
//    across data
// 4) The first 0x20000 is for the program, do not remove the offset
//    or your program will not function and there is a strong chance you'll
//    force a kernel panic when moving data or at the very least lock up the
//    application
// 5) The rest is the east/north/south/west memory location and the main
//    initilization symbols
//
// This script only works with north memory for now, it's feasible to change it
// for any other memory location if you wish. But know that if you keep using
// north memory the top row of tiles are in theory unusable as it has nowhere to
// 1) store data you write across
// 2) store the auto generated main files arg array which is used to pass
//    arguments to the kernel
//
// If in doubt ask Hyun Kwon about this as he engineered the concepts behind it!

// Future TODO: Make this .bcf file and the host -> device allocation
// functionallity more generic, ideally tiles should use their own memory
// not another tiles memory as we would like all tiles to be useable.
// This minimally requires 2 bcf files that will alternate based on the
// tiles position in the array. As some tiles have their own memory on the east
// and others on the west, based on the checker board pattern of the AIE array.
//
// The host -> device + host <- device transfers done by the host will probably
// also need tweaking based on the tiles position in the array. But this depends
// how we are encapsulating the transfers at that point (at time of writing we
// are using explicit read/write operations but perhaps AXI streaming is
// different and more generic/friendly).
